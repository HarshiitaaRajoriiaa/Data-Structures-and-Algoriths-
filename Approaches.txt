1. Sum of digits of any integer: 
    number%10 = last digit of number
    number/10 = give digit with removed last digit

2. Digital Root: This means that for any integer, the remainder when it is divided by 9 is the same as the remainder when the sum of its digits is divided by 9.
    General formula = sum = 1 + (n-1)%9
    example = 38mod9 = 11mod9 = 2
    i. if n%9==0 then sum of digits = 9 / 1+8 = 9, 3+6 = 9, 2+7 = 9...... 
    ii. if n%9!=0 then sum of digits until one digit is left = 199%9 = 1

3. Prime numbers:
    i. 1 is non-prime and non-composite integer
    ii.2 is only even and left are odd prime integer
    iii.Every even positive integer greater than 2 can be expressed as the sum of two primes.
    iv. Every prime number can be represented in form of 6n + 1 or 6n â€“ 1 except the prime numbers 2 and 3, where n is any natural number.
    5=6(1)-1 , 7 = 6(1)-1..........

4.  Euclidean algorithm:The key idea is that gcd(a,b)=gcd(b,a%b). This means that the GCD(two numbers) is the same as the GCD( the smaller number and the remainder when the larger number is divided by the smaller number).
